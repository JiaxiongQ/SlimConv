# SlimConv
This repository contains the code (in PyTorch) for "[SlimConv: Reducing Channel Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks by Weights Flipping](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Qiu_DeepLiDAR_Deep_Surface_Normal_Guided_Depth_Prediction_for_Outdoor_Scene_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)" paper (Arxiv)
## Note
The pretrained models on ImageNet will be released soon, you can use our module on your own tasks to reduce parameters, FLOPs and improve the performance.
